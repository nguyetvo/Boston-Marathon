Boston Marathon project

There is a lot of information on runners and their performance for the
Boston Marathon. Pick a year (post-2012 has more info) and do some
clustering.

Specifically, use the tools at hand to determine which clustering
solution, including number of clusters and algorithm used, is best for
the marathon data. Once you have a solution you like, write a data
story, including visualizations, where you teach the reader something
about the Boston Marathon based on your clusters. Write up your
report, including your process from start to finish. You must include
analysis as:

1. Draw bar graphs (both male & female in different color) for each
cluster for male and female, from the bar graphs, you can tell things
as which cluster contains the most number of female (or male).

2. Draw bar graphs for runners in different ranges of age (dividing by 3
groups: 18-25, 26-40, 40-70 or so) for each cluster (in different colors),
from the graph, you should be able to anwser which cluster contains
the most young people, which cluster contains oldest people, etc.

3. Do the same things as above for finishing time (which group runs
fastest).
